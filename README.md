# Phaser Wave Function Collapse Demo

Procedural map generation using the **Wave Function Collapse (WFC)** algorithm, built in **Phaser 3**.

- Press **R** to regenerate the map.
- The semi-transparent overlay shows approximate *entropy* (uncertainty).
- Red/yellow areas = higher entropy (more possibilities), blue areas = stable regions.
- Demonstrates local constraint propagation for procedural generation.
